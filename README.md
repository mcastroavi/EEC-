Problem1:
Write C++ code that sum the numbers from 1 to 100
Problem2:
a. Write C++ code that sum reciprocals (1/1 + 1/2 + … + 1/99 + 1/100)
b. Write C++ code that sum reciprocals (1/100 + 1/99 + ... 1/2 + 1/1)
compare a and b
Problem3:
a. Write C++ code that sum multiplication reciprocals (1/(1x1) + 1/(2x2) + … )
b. Write C++ code that sum reciprocals (1/(100x100) + 1/(99x99) + ... )
